# 💼 Payroll Accounting System

A simple and interactive **Payroll Accounting System** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project allows users to calculate employee salaries dynamically based on multiple parameters such as basic pay, bonuses, overtime, deductions, and tax.  

It’s designed as part of my **#100WeeksOfProjects** series to simulate a real-world payroll management interface.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters employee details such as:
   - Employee Name  
   - ID  
   - Basic Pay  
   - Bonus  
   - Overtime Hours  
   - Deductions  
   - Tax Percentage  

2. When the user clicks **“Calculate”**, the system:
   - Computes the **Net Salary** using the formula  
   - Displays the breakdown neatly on the page  
   - Optionally stores the data for later reference  

3. You can clear all records using the **Reset** button.
